# Promise Quiz

Folder: [2-promise-quiz](2-promise-quiz/)

A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure)
 of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A promise may be in one of 3 possible states:

- `pending`: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- `fulfilled`: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
- `rejected`: meaning that the operation failed.

 A promise has two methods:

- `then()`: to handle the fulfilled case.
- `catch()`: to handle the rejected case.

 A promise can be created using the Promise constructor.
