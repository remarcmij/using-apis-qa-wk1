    <h1>Hello, Async/Await!</h1>
    <p>
      A new way to handle promises using `async/await` was introduced in ES2017
      (ES8). This syntax allows you to write asynchronous code that looks
      synchronous, making it easier to read and maintain. The `async` keyword is
      used to declare an asynchronous function, and the `await` keyword is used
      to pause the execution of the function until the promise is resolved or
      rejected. In ES2022 the await operator was added to the top level of
      modules, allowing you to use ` outside of async functions. This means you
      can write asynchronous code at the top level of your module without
      wrapping it in an async function.
