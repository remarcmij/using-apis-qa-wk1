# Why Did We Use Callbacks Before Promises in JavaScript?

The reason we used callbacks before Promises became standard is mostly historical and practical:

## 1. Callbacks Came First

JavaScript originally had no native support for asynchronous abstractions. In the early days (pre-ES6), the only way to handle asynchronous operations (like I/O, timers, or AJAX) was through **callbacks**.

```javascript
fs.readFile('file.txt', function(err, data) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data.toString());
});
```

## 2. Simplicity and Control

Callbacks are just functions, and they give developers direct control over execution. They're easy to implement and understand in basic scenarios.

## 3. Standardization of Promises Came Later

Promises were standardized in **ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)**. Before that, various libraries like **jQuery**, **Q**, and **Bluebird** introduced their own Promise-like abstractions, but they weren't native.

## 4. Legacy Code and Ecosystem Inertia

A lot of older code and APIs were built with callbacks. It takes time for the ecosystem (libraries, tutorials, teams) to migrate. Even today, some low-level Node.js APIs still use callbacks for backward compatibility.

## Why Promises Took Over

Despite callbacks' simplicity, they have several problems:

- **Callback Hell:** Deeply nested and hard to follow.
- **Error Handling:** `try/catch` doesn't work; errors must be passed manually.
- **Inversion of Control:** You hand over control to another function, making flow management harder.

**Promises solve these by:**

- Flattening chains with `.then()` chaining
- Centralizing error handling with `.catch()`
- Supporting composition of async actions
- Serving as the foundation for `async/await`, which simplifies async code even more

## Summary

**We used callbacks because they were the only tool available.**  
Promises (and later `async/await`) are newer, cleaner abstractions that solve real problems callbacks introducedâ€”but they stand on the shoulders of callbacks, which paved the way.
