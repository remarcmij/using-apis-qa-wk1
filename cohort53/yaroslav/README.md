## Question 1:

Prompt for ChatGPT:

```plaintext
Please consider the following JavaScript code snippet:

<code>
function catWalk() {
  const img = document.querySelector("img");
  const startPos = -img.width;
  const centerPos = (window.innerWidth - 1.5 * img.width) / 2;
  const stopPos = window.innerWidth;
  walk(img, startPos, centerPos)
    .then(() => dance(img))
    .then(() => walk(img, centerPos, stopPos))
    .then(catWalk);
</code>

Is this code another implementation of recursion, where the 
actual number of recursion calls cannot be infinite and is 
limited by the recursion allowed depth?
```

Response:

### Is This Recursion?

Yes, technically, this **is recursion**: a function calls itself. However, it's **asynchronous recursion** via a Promise chain rather than synchronous recursion via a direct function call.

### Is It Limited by Call Stack Depth?

**No**, not in the same way that synchronous recursion is.

Here’s why:

- In synchronous recursion, each function call adds a frame to the **call stack**, and too many frames will trigger a *stack overflow* (commonly after a few thousand calls, depending on the JS engine).
- In this asynchronous pattern, each recursive call happens **after the current stack has cleared**, because Promises schedule their callbacks in the microtask queue.
- This means the stack is **not growing**, because the engine finishes the current execution context before entering the next `.then()`.

**Therefore**, this form of recursion is **not limited by recursion depth**, at least not in the traditional stack-based sense.

### Summary

| Property                        | Value                                                  |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Is it recursion?                | ✅ Yes                                                  |
| Is it synchronous?              | ❌ No – it's asynchronous via Promises                 |
| Is it limited by call stack?    | ❌ No – call stack is cleared between iterations       |
| Can it run indefinitely?        | ✅ In theory, yes, limited by available memory/time     |

This pattern is often referred to as **asynchronous looping** or **promise recursion**, and is safe for long-running operations without risking stack overflows.
